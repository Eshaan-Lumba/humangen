## App Design

Frontend: Flutter
Backend: Python

## Project Overview
The project uses the state of the art pix2pix machine learning algorithm. The algorithm takes in a drawing of a face, and outputs a predicted image of what a person in real life would look like based on the drawing. The algorithm learned using face images from [this website](generated.photo)
